# PS3 Blacklist Sniffer

*Description*:

This script is useful:
- If you want to detect one of the blacklisted people that are connecting
or connected to your session. (Even if they have an other
username in the game. (At the condition that they still have
the same IP than the 'Blacklist.ini' given IP.)
- If one of the blacklisted people are not in your session but that
they tries to join it, you will detect them before they will be there.
